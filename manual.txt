NAME
	LR (Linear Regression)
	Version 1.0.0
SYNOPSIS
	./LR.out [args]
DESCRIPTION
	Linear regression demo made with C standard libs. 
OPTIONS
	-V	Verbose mode, prints values of vars every iteration. 
	-t	Thread mode, enable muti-thread. Might increase calculation speed if batch_size is large. 
	-s [seed]	Define seed, use the seed to generate random, can duplicate run. If not enabled, the program will seed using time (timestamp * nsec). 
	-f [filename]	Write info per iteration to a file, in CSV format. Creates one if file doesn't exist, ask if overwrite if it does. 
	-A [functionnum]	Define which activation function to use, 0 is default. 
		functionnum:
			0: None
			1: ReLU
			2: LeakyReLU
			3: Sigmoid
			4: Tanh
	-b [batchsize]	Define how large is one batch (batch_size), 256 is default. 
	-e [eta]	Define eta (learning rate), 0.001 is default. 
	-l [expectedloss]	Define expected loss, the training ends when loss < expectedloss, 0.0001 is default. 
	-v	Print version info. 
	-h	Help (manual) page, prints this manual.
